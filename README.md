# Welcome to My First Python Project: Dice Game

## Introduction

Welcome to my very first Python project, the Dice Game! As someone new to the world of programming, I embarked on this journey to learn Python, and this project marks my initial foray into the language. 

## Description

This simple yet engaging project brings the excitement of a classic dice game to life using Python. Players take turns rolling a virtual dice, accumulating points with each roll. The objective? To be the first player to reach a predetermined maximum score and emerge victorious!

## Features

- **User Interaction:** Enjoy an interactive gaming experience with intuitive user prompts.
- **Randomness:** Experience the thrill of random dice rolls powered by Python's `random` module.
- **Flexibility:** Play with a customizable number of players (from 2 to 4), making it ideal for family gatherings or game nights with friends.
