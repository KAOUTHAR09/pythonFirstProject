# Welcome to My First Python Project: Dice Game

## Introduction

Welcome to my very first Python project, the Dice Game! As someone new to the world of programming, I embarked on this journey to learn Python, and this project marks my initial foray into the language. 

## Description

This simple yet engaging project brings the excitement of a classic dice game to life using Python. Players take turns rolling a virtual dice, accumulating points with each roll. The objective? To be the first player to reach a predetermined maximum score and emerge victorious!

## Features

- **User Interaction:** Enjoy an interactive gaming experience with intuitive user prompts.
- **Randomness:** Experience the thrill of random dice rolls powered by Python's `random` module.
- **Flexibility:** Play with a customizable number of players (from 2 to 4), making it ideal for family gatherings or game nights with friends.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the game, make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/KAOUTHAR09/pythonFirstProject.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
    ```sh
    cd pythonFirstProject.git
### usage
1. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python3 dice_game.py
2. Follow the prompts to enter the number of players (2 to 4 players) and play the game.
3. Each player takes turns rolling the dice, accumulating points.
4. The first player to reach a specified maximum score wins the game.

### Example
Here's a sample run of the game:

    ```
    How many players are there? (max is 4 players): 3
    Player 1's turn has started
    Would you like to roll? (y or n): y
    You rolled a 3
    Your current score is 3
    Would you like to roll? (y or n): y
    You rolled a 5
    Your current score is 8
    Would you like to roll? (y or n): n
    Player 1's score is 8

    Player 2's turn has started
    Would you like to roll? (y or n): y
    You rolled a 2
    Your current score is 2
    Would you like to roll? (y or n): y
    You rolled a 4
    Your current score is 6
    Would you like to roll? (y or n): n
    Player 2's score is 6

    Player 3's turn has started
    Would you like to roll? (y or n): y
    You rolled a 6
    Your current score is 6
    Would you like to roll? (y or n): y
    You rolled a 1
    Your turn is over
    Player 3's score is 6
